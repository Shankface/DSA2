# Data Structures and Algorithms 2
In this class I created a Hash Table, a Binary Heap, code that performs Dijkstra's Algorithm, and code that demonstartes dynamic programming.

Project 1: Hash Table for uploading dictionary and performing spellchecks on documents
Project 2: Binary Heap
Project 3: Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding shortest paths from one node to others
Project 4: Checks if a given word is a valid merge of two given words using dynamic programming
